# LVIS Project

The main purpose of this project was to develop a library of python code to process NASA's LVIS LiDAR data to examine ice mass change of Pine Island Glacier from acquisition flights in 2009 and 2015.

## Data
**PIG:**  In this study, the spatial extent of Pine Island Glacier (PIG) was defined as the marine-terminating subset of that defined by the GLIMS Glacier Database. The study area was manually assigned informed by both the GLIMS shapefile and LVIS flight paths in both 2009 and 2015. The shapefile used in this project is accessible in `shapes/pine_island_glacier.shp` alongside its supplementary files.   

**LVIS:** NASA's Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor [(LVIS)](https://lvis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Home/index.html) is an airborne LiDAR instrument which retrieves data on surface topography and 3-D structure. This project was designed to deal with LVIS data acquired during NASA's [Operation IceBridge](https://icebridge.gsfc.nasa.gov/), which monitored key glaciers at the poles during the gap in ICESat (2003-09) and ICESat-2 (2018-) missions. The LVIS data is available on the [NASA Earth Data Portal](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=LVIS) or via the [LVIS webpage](https://lvis.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data/GE.html?status=submitted).
